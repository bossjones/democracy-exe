"""
This router_agent.py file defines the RouterAgent class, which is responsible for directing queries to the appropriate specialized agent:
The RouterAgent class inherits from BaseAgent.
It maintains a dictionary of specialized agents that can be added dynamically.
The route method implements the logic for determining which specialized agent should handle a given query. This can be expanded or refined as needed.
The process method uses the routing logic to delegate the query to the appropriate specialized agent, or returns a default response if no suitable agent is found.
Next, let's look at the memory_agent.py file:
