"""
This image_analysis_graph.py file defines the ImageAnalysisGraph class, which encapsulates the functionality for analyzing images:
The ImageAnalysisGraph class inherits from BaseGraph and implements the build method.
It has an ImageAnalysisAgent instance to handle the actual image analysis operations.
The build method constructs the graph:
It adds the main image analysis agent node.
It adds nodes for different stages of the image analysis process: preprocessing, object detection, image classification, and description generation.
It adds edges to create the analysis flow, allowing for a complete image analysis cycle.
It sets the entry point of the graph to the main analysis node.
The process method compiles the graph and processes the given state.
The preprocess_image, detect_objects, classify_image, and generate_description methods correspond to the different stages of the image analysis process. They update the state with the results of each stage.
An instance of ImageAnalysisGraph is created at the module level for easy access.
This implementation provides a structured approach to image analysis within the AI system. The analysis process is broken down into distinct stages, each handled by a separate node in the graph. This modular design makes it easy to modify or extend individual parts of the analysis process as needed.
The cyclic nature of the graph allows for potential refinement or iterative analysis if such functionality is desired in the future. For example, you could add edges to revisit earlier stages based on the results of later stages.
