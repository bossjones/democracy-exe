Image/Text processor class for Chinese-CLIP
"""
class ChineseCLIPProcessor(ProcessorMixin):
    r"""
    Constructs a Chinese-CLIP processor which wraps a Chinese-CLIP image processor and a Chinese-CLIP tokenizer into a
    single processor.

    [`ChineseCLIPProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`ChineseCLIPImageProcessor`] and [`BertTokenizerFast`].
    See the [`~ChineseCLIPProcessor.__call__`] and [`~ChineseCLIPProcessor.decode`] for more information.

    Args:
        image_processor ([`ChineseCLIPImageProcessor`], *optional*):
            The image processor is a required input.
        tokenizer ([`BertTokenizerFast`], *optional*):
            The tokenizer is a required input.

        Main method to prepare for the model one or several sequences(s) and image(s). This method forwards the `text`
        and `kwargs` arguments to BertTokenizerFast's [`~BertTokenizerFast.__call__`] if `text` is not `None` to encode
        the text. To prepare the image(s), this method forwards the `images` and `kwrags` arguments to
        CLIPImageProcessor's [`~CLIPImageProcessor.__call__`] if `images` is not `None`. Please refer to the doctsring
        of the above two methods for more information.

        Args:
            text (`str`, `List[str]`, `List[List[str]]`):
                The sequence or batch of sequences to be encoded. Each sequence can be a string or a list of strings
                (pretokenized string). If the sequences are provided as list of strings (pretokenized), you must set
                `is_split_into_words=True` (to lift the ambiguity with a batch of sequences).
            images (`PIL.Image.Image`, `np.ndarray`, `torch.Tensor`, `List[PIL.Image.Image]`, `List[np.ndarray]`, `List[torch.Tensor]`):
                The image or batch of images to be prepared. Each image can be a PIL image, NumPy array or PyTorch
                tensor. Both channels-first and channels-last formats are supported.

            return_tensors (`str` or [`~utils.TensorType`], *optional*):
                If set, will return tensors of a particular framework. Acceptable values are:

                - `'tf'`: Return TensorFlow `tf.constant` objects.
                - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
                - `'np'`: Return NumPy `np.ndarray` objects.
                - `'jax'`: Return JAX `jnp.ndarray` objects.

        Returns:
            [`BatchEncoding`]: A [`BatchEncoding`] with the following fields:

            - **input_ids** -- List of token ids to be fed to a model. Returned when `text` is not `None`.
            - **attention_mask** -- List of indices specifying which tokens should be attended to by the model (when
              `return_attention_mask=True` or if *"attention_mask"* is in `self.model_input_names` and if `text` is not
              `None`).
            - **pixel_values** -- Pixel values to be fed to a model. Returned when `images` is not `None`.
