        Transcribes or translates log-mel input features to a sequence of auto-regressively generated token ids.

        <Tip warning={true}>

        Most generation-controlling parameters are set in `generation_config` which, if not passed, will be set to the
        model's default generation configuration. You can override any `generation_config` by passing the corresponding
        parameters to generate(), e.g. `.generate(inputs, num_beams=4, do_sample=True)`.

        For an overview of generation strategies and code examples, check out the [following
        guide](./generation_strategies).

        </Tip>

        Parameters:
            input_features (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, feature_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
                Float values of log-mel features extracted from the raw speech waveform. The raw speech waveform can be obtained by
                loading a `.flac` or `.wav` audio file into an array of type `List[float]` or a `numpy.ndarray`, *e.g.* via
                the soundfile library (`pip install soundfile`). To prepare the array into `input_features`, the
                [`AutoFeatureExtractor`] should be used for extracting the mel features, padding and conversion into a
                tensor of type `torch.FloatTensor`. See [`~WhisperFeatureExtractor.__call__`] for details.
            generation_config (`~generation.GenerationConfig`, *optional*):
                The generation configuration to be used as base parametrization for the generation call. `**kwargs`
                passed to generate matching the attributes of `generation_config` will override them. If
                `generation_config` is not provided, the default will be used, which had the following loading
                priority: 1) from the `generation_config.json` model file, if it exists; 2) from the model
                configuration. Please note that unspecified parameters will inherit [`~generation.GenerationConfig`]'s
                default values, whose documentation should be checked to parameterize generation.
            logits_processor (`LogitsProcessorList`, *optional*):
                Custom logits processors that complement the default logits processors built from arguments and
                generation config. If a logit processor is passed that is already created with the arguments or a
                generation config an error is thrown. This feature is intended for advanced users.
            stopping_criteria (`StoppingCriteriaList`, *optional*):
                Custom stopping criteria that complement the default stopping criteria built from arguments and a
                generation config. If a stopping criteria is passed that is already created with the arguments or a
                generation config an error is thrown. This feature is intended for advanced users.
            prefix_allowed_tokens_fn (`Callable[[int, torch.Tensor], List[int]]`, *optional*):
                If provided, this function constraints the beam search to allowed tokens only at each step. If not
                provided no constraint is applied. This function takes 2 arguments: the batch ID `batch_id` and
                `input_ids`. It has to return a list with the allowed tokens for the next generation step conditioned
                on the batch ID `batch_id` and the previously generated tokens `inputs_ids`. This argument is useful
                for constrained generation conditioned on the prefix, as described in [Autoregressive Entity
                Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00904).
            synced_gpus (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether to continue running the while loop until max_length (needed to avoid deadlocking with
                `FullyShardedDataParallel` and DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3).
            return_timestamps (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether to return the timestamps with the text. This enables the `WhisperTimestampsLogitsProcessor`.
            task (`str`, *optional*):
                Task to use for generation, either "translate" or "transcribe". The `model.config.forced_decoder_ids`
                will be updated accordingly.
            language (`str` or list of `str`, *optional*):
                Language token to use for generation, can be either in the form of `<|en|>`, `en` or `english`. For
                batched generation, a list of language tokens can be passed. You can find all the possible language
                tokens in the `model.generation_config.lang_to_id` dictionary.
            is_multilingual (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether or not the model is multilingual.
            prompt_ids (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*):
                Rank-1 tensor of token IDs created by passing text to [`~WhisperProcessor.get_prompt_ids`] that is
                provided as a prompt to each chunk. This can be used to provide or "prompt-engineer" a context for
                transcription, e.g. custom vocabularies or proper nouns to make it more likely to predict those words
                correctly. It cannot be used in conjunction with `decoder_start_token_id` as it overwrites this value.
            prompt_condition_type (`str`, *optional*):
                Only relevant for long-form transcription. Condition type of `prompt_ids`. 'first-segment' means only the first segment is conditioned on `prompt_ids`. 'all-segments' means each segment is conditioned on `prompt_ids`. Make sure to enable `condition_on_prev_tokens` for 'all-segments'.
                Defaults to 'first-segment'. For short-term transcription only 'first-segment' is possible.
            condition_on_prev_tokens (`bool`, *optional*):
                Only relevant for long-form transcription. Whether to condition each segment on the previous segment.
                As shown in the [the Whisper paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf), this can help to improve
                performance.
            temperature (`float` or list of `float`, *optional*):
                The temperature to be used for generation. Passing a single `float` value and `do_sample=True` activates
                generation using sampling. For long-form transcription, temperature fallback can be activated by passing
                a list of float values such as (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0). As shown in the [the Whisper paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf), this can help to improve
                performance.
            compression_ratio_threshold (`float`, *optional*):
                Only relevant for long-form transcription. If defined, the zlib compression rate of each segment will be computed. If the compression rate of
                a segment is higher than `compression_ratio_threshold`, temperature fallback is activated: the generated segment is discarded and the generation is
                repeated using a higher temperature. The intuition behind this feature is that segments with very high compression rates
                suffer from a lot of repetition. The unwanted repetition can be reduced by injecting more randomness by increasing the temperature. If `compression_ratio_threshold` is defined
                make sure that `temperature` is a list of values. A common value for `compression_ratio_threshold` is 1.35.
                As shown in the [the Whisper paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf), this can help to improve
                performance.
            logprob_threshold (`float`, *optional*):
                Only relevant for long-form transcription. If defined, the average log-probability of each segment will be computed. If the log-probability of
                a given segment is lower than `logprob_threshold`, temperature fallback is activated: the generated segment is discarded and the generation is
                repeated using a higher temperature. The intuition behind this feature is that segments of low log-probability
                can be improved by injecting more randomness by increasing the temperature. If `logprob_threshold` is defined
                make sure that `temperature` is a list of values. A common value for `logprob_threshold` is -1.0.
                As shown in the [the Whisper paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf), this can help to improve
                performance.
            no_speech_threshold (`float`, *optional*):
                Only relevant for long-form transcription. If defined, the "no-speech" token combined with the `logprob_threshold`
                is used to determine whether a segment contains only silence. In this case, the transcription for this segment
                is skipped.
                As shown in the [the Whisper paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf), this can help to improve
                performance.
            num_segment_frames (`int`, *optional*):
                The number of frames a single segment is made of. If not defined, `num_segment_frames` defaults to the model's stride
                times the maximum input length.
            attention_mask (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*):
                `attention_mask` needs to be passed when doing long-form transcription using a batch size > 1.
            time_precision (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0.02):
                The duration of output token in seconds. *E.g.* 0.02 means that a generated token on average accounts
                for 20 ms.
            return_token_timestamps (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether to return token-level timestamps with the text. This can be used with or without the
                `return_timestamps` option. To get word-level timestamps, use the tokenizer to group the tokens into
                words.
            return_segments (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether to additionally return a list of all segments. Note that this option can only be enabled
                when doing long-form transcription.
            return_dict_in_generate (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to return a [`~utils.ModelOutput`] instead of just returning the generated tokens.
                Note that when doing long-form transcription, `return_dict_in_generate` can only be enabled when
                `return_segments` is set True. In this case the generation outputs of each segment is added to each
                segment.
            kwargs (`Dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
                Ad hoc parametrization of `generate_config` and/or additional model-specific kwargs that will be
                forwarded to the `forward` function of the model. If the model is an encoder-decoder model, encoder
                specific kwargs should not be prefixed and decoder specific kwargs should be prefixed with *decoder_*.

        Return:
            [`~utils.ModelOutput`] or `torch.LongTensor` or `Dict[str, Any]`: A [`~utils.ModelOutput`] (if `return_dict_in_generate=True`
            or when `config.return_dict_in_generate=True`) or a `torch.FloatTensor` or a dict of segments when `return_segments=True`.

                If the passed input is > 30 seconds / > 3000 mel input features and `return_segments=True` then a dictionary of generated sequence ids, called `sequences` and a list of each generated segment is returned.

                else if the passed input is <= 30 seconds / >= 3000 mel input features, the possible [`~utils.ModelOutput`] types are:

                    - [`~generation.GenerateEncoderDecoderOutput`],
                    - [`~generation.GenerateBeamEncoderDecoderOutput`]

                else only the generated output sequence ids are returned.

        Example:

        - *Longform transcription*: To transcribe or translate audios longer than 30 seconds, process the audio files without truncation and pass all mel features at once to generate.

        ```python
        >>> import torch
        >>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, WhisperForConditionalGeneration
        >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Audio

        >>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-tiny.en")
        >>> model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-tiny.en")
        >>> model.cuda()  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT

        >>> # load audios > 30 seconds
        >>> ds = load_dataset("distil-whisper/meanwhile", "default")["test"]
        >>> # resample to 16kHz
        >>> ds = ds.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=16000))
        >>> # take first 8 audios and retrieve array
        >>> audio = ds[:8]["audio"]
        >>> audio = [x["array"] for x in audio]

        >>> # make sure to NOT truncate the input audio, to return the `attention_mask` and to pad to the longest audio
        >>> inputs = processor(audio, return_tensors="pt", truncation=False, padding="longest", return_attention_mask=True, sampling_rate=16_000)
        >>> inputs = inputs.to("cuda", torch.float32)

        >>> # transcribe audio to ids
        >>> generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs)

        >>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
        >>> transcription[0]
        " Folks, if you watch the show, you know, I spent a lot of time right over there. Patiently and astutely scrutinizing the boxwood and mahogany chest set of the day's biggest stories developing the central headline pawns, definitely maneuvering an oso topical night to F6, fainting a classic Sicilian, nade door variation on the news, all the while seeing eight moves deep and patiently marshalling the latest press releases into a fisher's shows in Lip Nitsky attack that culminates in the elegant lethal slow-played, all-passant checkmate that is my nightly monologue. But sometimes, sometimes, folks, I. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Sometimes I startle away, cubside down in the monkey bars of a condemned playground on a super fun site. Get all hept up on goofballs.

        ```

        - *Shortform transcription*: If passed mel input features are < 30 seconds, the whole audio will be transcribed with a single call to generate.

        ```python
        >>> import torch
        >>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, WhisperForConditionalGeneration
        >>> from datasets import load_dataset

        >>> inputs = processor(ds[0]["audio"]["array"], return_tensors="pt")
        >>> input_features = inputs.input_features

        >>> generated_ids = model.generate(inputs=input_features)
