def lagrange(x, w): # -> poly1d:
    r"""
    Return a Lagrange interpolating polynomial.

    Given two 1-D arrays `x` and `w,` returns the Lagrange interpolating
    polynomial through the points ``(x, w)``.

    Warning: This implementation is numerically unstable. Do not expect to
    be able to use more than about 20 points even if they are chosen optimally.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        `x` represents the x-coordinates of a set of datapoints.
    w : array_like
        `w` represents the y-coordinates of a set of datapoints, i.e., f(`x`).

    Returns
    -------
    lagrange : `numpy.poly1d` instance
        The Lagrange interpolating polynomial.

    Examples
    --------
    Interpolate :math:`f(x) = x^3` by 3 points.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.interpolate import lagrange
    >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2])
    >>> y = x**3
    >>> poly = lagrange(x, y)

    Since there are only 3 points, Lagrange polynomial has degree 2. Explicitly,
    it is given by

    .. math::

        \begin{aligned}
            L(x) &= 1\times \frac{x (x - 2)}{-1} + 8\times \frac{x (x-1)}{2} \\
                 &= x (-2 + 3x)

class interp1d(_Interpolator1D):

    Interpolate a 1-D function.

    .. legacy:: class

        For a guide to the intended replacements for `interp1d` see
        :ref:`tutorial-interpolate_1Dsection`.

    `x` and `y` are arrays of values used to approximate some function f:
    ``y = f(x)``. This class returns a function whose call method uses
    interpolation to find the value of new points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (npoints, ) array_like
        A 1-D array of real values.
    y : (..., npoints, ...) array_like
        A N-D array of real values. The length of `y` along the interpolation
        axis must be equal to the length of `x`. Use the ``axis`` parameter
        to select correct axis. Unlike other interpolators, the default
        interpolation axis is the last axis of `y`.
    kind : str or int, optional
        Specifies the kind of interpolation as a string or as an integer
        specifying the order of the spline interpolator to use.
        The string has to be one of 'linear', 'nearest', 'nearest-up', 'zero',
        'slinear', 'quadratic', 'cubic', 'previous', or 'next'. 'zero',
        'slinear', 'quadratic' and 'cubic' refer to a spline interpolation of
        zeroth, first, second or third order; 'previous' and 'next' simply
        return the previous or next value of the point; 'nearest-up' and
        'nearest' differ when interpolating half-integers (e.g. 0.5, 1.5)
        in that 'nearest-up' rounds up and 'nearest' rounds down. Default
        is 'linear'.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis in the ``y`` array corresponding to the x-coordinate values. Unlike
        other interpolators, defaults to ``axis=-1``.
    copy : bool, optional
        If ``True``, the class makes internal copies of x and y. If ``False``,
        references to ``x`` and ``y`` are used if possible. The default is to copy.
    bounds_error : bool, optional
        If True, a ValueError is raised any time interpolation is attempted on
        a value outside of the range of x (where extrapolation is
        necessary). If False, out of bounds values are assigned `fill_value`.
        By default, an error is raised unless ``fill_value="extrapolate"``.
    fill_value : array-like or (array-like, array_like) or "extrapolate", optional
        - if a ndarray (or float), this value will be used to fill in for
          requested points outside of the data range. If not provided, then
          the default is NaN. The array-like must broadcast properly to the
          dimensions of the non-interpolation axes.
        - If a two-element tuple, then the first element is used as a
          fill value for ``x_new < x[0]`` and the second element is used for
          ``x_new > x[-1]``. Anything that is not a 2-element tuple (e.g.,
          list or ndarray, regardless of shape) is taken to be a single
          array-like argument meant to be used for both bounds as
          ``below, above = fill_value, fill_value``. Using a two-element tuple
          or ndarray requires ``bounds_error=False``.

          .. versionadded:: 0.17.0
        - If "extrapolate", then points outside the data range will be
          extrapolated.

          .. versionadded:: 0.17.0
    assume_sorted : bool, optional
        If False, values of `x` can be in any order and they are sorted first.
        If True, `x` has to be an array of monotonically increasing values.

    Notes
    -----
    Calling `interp1d` with NaNs present in input values results in
    undefined behaviour.

    Input values `x` and `y` must be convertible to `float` values like
    `int` or `float`.

    If the values in `x` are not unique, the resulting behavior is
    undefined and specific to the choice of `kind`, i.e., changing
    `kind` will change the behavior for duplicates.

        Construct an interpolating spline and convert it to a `PPoly` instance

        >>> from scipy.interpolate import splrep, PPoly
        >>> x = np.linspace(0, 1, 11)

        >>> isinstance(p, PPoly)
        True

        Note that this function only supports 1D splines out of the box.

        If the ``tck`` object represents a parametric spline (e.g. constructed
        by `splprep` or a `BSpline` with ``c.ndim > 1``), you will need to loop
        over the dimensions manually.

        >>> from scipy.interpolate import splprep, splev
        >>> t = np.linspace(0, 1, 11)
        >>> x = np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
        >>> y = np.cos(2*np.pi*t)

        Note that ``c`` is a list of two arrays of length 11.

        >>> unew = np.arange(0, 1.01, 0.01)
        >>> out = splev(unew, (t, c, k))

        To convert this spline to the power basis, we convert each
        component of the list of b-spline coefficients, ``c``, into the
        corresponding cubic polynomial.

        >>> polys = [PPoly.from_spline((t, cj, k)) for cj in c]
        >>> polys[0].c.shape
        (4, 14)

        Note that the coefficients of the polynomials `polys` are in the
        power basis and their dimensions reflect just that: here 4 is the order
        (degree+1), and 14 is the number of intervals---which is nothing but
        the length of the knot array of the original `tck` minus one.

        Notes
        -----
        If ``k`` derivatives are specified at a breakpoint ``x``, the
        constructed polynomial is exactly ``k`` times continuously
        differentiable at ``x``, unless the ``order`` is provided explicitly.
        In the latter case, the smoothness of the polynomial at
        the breakpoint is controlled by the ``order``.

        Deduces the number of derivatives to match at each end
        from ``order`` and the number of derivatives available. If
        possible it uses the same number of derivatives from
        each end; if the number is odd it tries to take the
        extra one from y2. In any case if not enough derivatives
        are available at one end or another it draws enough to
        make up the total from the other end.

        If the order is too high and not enough derivatives are available,
        an exception is raised.

        Examples
        --------

        >>> from scipy.interpolate import BPoly
        >>> BPoly.from_derivatives([0, 1], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])

        Creates a polynomial `f(x)` of degree 3, defined on `[0, 1]`
        such that `f(0) = 1, df/dx(0) = 2, f(1) = 3, df/dx(1) = 4`

        >>> BPoly.from_derivatives([0, 1, 2], [[0, 1], [0], [2]])

        Creates a piecewise polynomial `f(x)`, such that
        `f(0) = f(1) = 0`, `f(2) = 2`, and `df/dx(0) = 1`.
        Based on the number of derivatives provided, the order of the
        local polynomials is 2 on `[0, 1]` and 1 on `[1, 2]`.
        Notice that no restriction is imposed on the derivatives at
        ``x = 1`` and ``x = 2``.

        Indeed, the explicit form of the polynomial is::

            f(x) = | x * (1 - x),  0 <= x < 1
                   | 2 * (x - 1),  1 <= x <= 2
