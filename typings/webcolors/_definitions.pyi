    Return the list of valid color names for the given specification.

    The color names will be normalized to all-lowercase, and will be returned in
    alphabetical order.

    .. note:: **Spelling variants**

       Some values representing named gray colors can map to either of two names in
       CSS3, because it supports both ``"gray"`` and ``"grey"`` spelling variants for
       those colors. Functions which produce a name from a color value in other formats
       all normalize to the ``"gray"`` spelling for consistency with earlier CSS and
       HTML specifications which only supported ``"gray"``. Here, however, *all* valid
       names are returned, including -- for CSS3 -- both variant spellings for each of
       the affected ``"gray"``/``"grey"`` colors.

    Examples:

    .. doctest::

        >>> names(spec=HTML4)
        ['aqua', 'black', 'blue', 'fuchsia', 'gray', 'green',
         'lime', 'maroon', 'navy', 'olive', 'purple', 'red',
         'silver', 'teal', 'white', 'yellow']
        >>> names(spec="CSS1")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        ValueError: "CSS1" is not a supported specification ...


    :raises ValueError: when the given spec is not supported.
