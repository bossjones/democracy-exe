To modify the file for more efficient code generation with Sonnet 3.5, focusing on Python, and to receive only the changes rather than full responses, consider the following adjustments:

1. Add a specific instruction to return only modified portions of code:
   Add this line under the <restrictions> section:
   ```xml
   <standard>Return only modified portions of code in generation results to optimize token usage.</standard>
   ```

2. Enhance the prompt engineering standards:
   In the <prompt_engineering_standards> section, add:
   ```xml
   <output_format>
   <standard>Specify that responses should only include changed or new code snippets, not entire functions or files.</standard>
   <standard>Use diff-like format to clearly indicate additions and deletions when appropriate.</standard>
   </output_format>
   ```

3. Update the Python code quality section:
   Add this line to the <code_quality> section:
   ```xml
   <standard>Skip type annotations and docstrings for marimo notebook cells (files prefixed with `marimo_*`) that use the pattern `@app.cell def __()`.</standard>
   ```

4. Modify the personalization section:
   Update the <personalization> section to include:
   ```xml
   <standard>Prioritize Python-specific optimizations and best practices in code generation responses.</standard>
   ```

5. Add a specific instruction for code generation:
   In the main instructions section, add:
   ```xml
   <instruction>When generating or modifying code, return only the changed or new portions, not the entire function or file.</instruction>
   ```

These changes will help focus the context on Python code generation and instruct the model to return only the necessary changes, making it easier to apply the generated code.
