Module Overview:
- The module provides a mock implementation of a `discord.state.ConnectionState` class named `FakeState`.
- It allows for hooking into the methods of a Discord client's default state and provides support for test-related features.
- The module is designed for testing Discord bot functionality without requiring an actual connection to the Discord API.

Key Features:
- Overrides methods that could cause issues during testing.
- Supports temporarily disabling event dispatch to the client.
- Provides mock implementations for querying guild members and creating channels.
- Integrates with the `factories` and `backend` modules for creating fake data.

Installation and Setup:
1. Ensure you have Python installed (version X.X.X or higher).
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install discord.py pytest pytest-mock pytest-asyncio
   ```
3. Clone or download the module's source code from the repository.
4. Import the `FakeState` class in your test files.

Usage Guide:
1. Create an instance of `FakeState` in your test setup:
   ```python
   from fake_state import FakeState

   @pytest.fixture
   def fake_state(client, http):
       return FakeState(client, http)
   ```

2. Use the `FakeState` instance to control event dispatch and interact with the mock Discord state:
   ```python
   def test_bot_command(fake_state, client):
       fake_state.stop_dispatch()
       # Simulate a command execution
       client.dispatch('message', mock_message)
       # Assert the expected behavior
       assert not client.command_invoked
       fake_state.start_dispatch()
   ```

3. Customize the behavior of `FakeState` methods as needed for your specific test cases.

Testing Guide:

Test Case 1: Test stopping event dispatch
```python
def test_stop_dispatch(fake_state, client, mocker):
    """
    Test that stopping dispatch prevents events from being processed.
    """
    # Set up test fixtures
    mock_dispatch = mocker.patch.object(client, 'dispatch')

    # Execute test
    fake_state.stop_dispatch()
    client.dispatch('message', mock_message)

    # Assertions
    mock_dispatch.assert_not_called()
```

Test Case 2: Test querying guild members
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_query_members(fake_state, guild, members):
    """
    Test querying guild members.
    """
    # Set up test fixtures
    fake_state._get_guild = lambda _: guild
    guild.members = members

    # Execute test
    result = await fake_state.query_members(guild, '', 100, None, True, True)

    # Assertions
    assert result == members
```

Test Case 3: Test parsing channel create event
```python
def test_parse_channel_create(fake_state, guild, channel_data, mocker):
    """
    Test parsing channel create event.
    """
    # Set up test fixtures
    mock_dispatch = mocker.patch.object(fake_state, 'dispatch')
    channel_data['guild_id'] = guild.id
    fake_state._get_guild = lambda _: guild

    # Execute test
    fake_state.parse_channel_create(channel_data)

    # Assertions
    mock_dispatch.assert_called_once_with('guild_channel_create', mocker.ANY)
    assert len(guild._channels) == 1
```

Testing Best Practices:
- Use pytest as the testing framework.
- Utilize pytest fixtures for setting up test dependencies and reusable objects.
- Use `pytest-asyncio` for testing asynchronous code.
- Use `pytest-mock` for mocking and patching dependencies.
- Follow a clear and consistent naming convention for test files and functions.
- Write focused and isolated test cases.
- Use assertions to verify expected behavior.
- Ensure proper cleanup and teardown of test fixtures.

Common Test Fixtures:
- `fake_state`: Provides an instance of `FakeState` for testing.
- `client`: Represents a mock Discord client.
- `guild`: Represents a mock Discord guild.
- `channel`: Represents a mock Discord channel.
- `member`: Represents a mock Discord member.

Error Handling and Edge Cases:
- Test scenarios where required data is missing or invalid.
- Verify that the module handles unexpected input gracefully.
- Test edge cases such as empty queries or limit values.

Integration Testing:
- Test the integration of `FakeState` with other components of the Discord bot.
- Ensure that the mock state behaves correctly when interacting with real Discord objects.
- Verify that events and dispatches are handled as expected.

Debugging and Troubleshooting:
- Use pytest's verbose output (`-v` flag) to get detailed test results.
- Utilize pytest's debugging options (`--pdb` flag) to pause execution on failures.
- Make use of Python's built-in `logging` module to add debug logs in the module.
- Use breakpoints and debugging tools like `pdb` or an IDE's debugger to step through the code.

Please note that this documentation provides a general overview and examples. You may need to adjust and expand upon it based on your specific module's requirements and functionality.
