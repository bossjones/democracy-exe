Module Overview:
The provided Python module is a testing framework for Discord bots built with the discord.py library. It allows developers to create comprehensive test suites for their Discord bots by simulating various Discord interactions and events. The module provides a high-level API for configuring the test environment, sending messages, adding reactions, managing roles, and more.

Key Features:
- Easy setup and configuration of the test environment
- Simulation of Discord events and interactions
- Retrieval of sent messages and embeds
- Management of roles and permissions
- Customizable test data generation
- Integration with pytest for test organization and execution

Installation and Setup:
1. Install the module using pip:
   ```
   pip install discord-test-framework
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules in your test files:
   ```python
   import discord
   from discord.ext import test
   ```

3. Configure the test environment in your test setup:
   ```python
   def test_setup():
       client = discord.Client()
       test.configure(client, guilds=2, text_channels=3, members=5)
   ```

Usage Guide:
1. Sending Messages:
   ```python
   @test.require_config
   async def test_send_message():
       channel = test.get_config().channels[0]
       member = test.get_config().members[1]
       message = await test.message("Hello, world!", channel=channel, member=member)
       assert message.content == "Hello, world!"
   ```

2. Managing Roles:
   ```python
   @test.require_config
   async def test_manage_roles():
       member = test.get_config().members[0]
       role = discord.utils.get(member.guild.roles, name="Test Role")
       await test.add_role(member, role)
       assert role in member.roles
       await test.remove_role(member, role)
       assert role not in member.roles
   ```

3. Adding Reactions:
   ```python
   @test.require_config
   async def test_add_reaction():
       channel = test.get_config().channels[0]
       message = await test.message("React to me!", channel=channel)
       user = test.get_config().members[0]
       await test.add_reaction(user, message, "ðŸ˜„")
       assert "ðŸ˜„" in [str(r.emoji) for r in message.reactions]
   ```

Testing Guide:
1. Test sending a message to a channel:
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.asyncio
   async def test_send_message(config):
       channel = config.channels[0]
       message = await test.message("Test message", channel=channel)
       assert message.content == "Test message"
       assert message.channel == channel
   ```

2. Test adding a role to a member:
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.asyncio
   async def test_add_role(config):
       member = config.members[0]
       role = discord.utils.get(member.guild.roles, name="Test Role")
       await test.add_role(member, role)
       assert role in member.roles
   ```

3. Test adding a reaction to a message:
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.asyncio
   async def test_add_reaction(config):
       channel = config.channels[0]
       message = await test.message("React to me!", channel=channel)
       user = config.members[0]
       await test.add_reaction(user, message, "ðŸ˜„")
       assert "ðŸ˜„" in [str(r.emoji) for r in message.reactions]
   ```

Testing Best Practices:
- Use pytest for organizing and running tests
- Utilize pytest fixtures for test setup and teardown
- Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator for asynchronous tests
- Leverage the `test.require_config` decorator to ensure proper test configuration
- Use meaningful assert statements to validate test outcomes
- Maintain test isolation by resetting the test environment between tests

Common Test Fixtures:
1. `config` fixture:
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def config():
       client = discord.Client()
       test.configure(client, guilds=2, text_channels=3, members=5)
       return test.get_config()
   ```

2. `bot` fixture:
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   async def bot():
       client = discord.Client()
       test.configure(client)
       await client.login("BOT_TOKEN")
       yield client
       await client.logout()
   ```

Error Handling and Edge Cases:
- Use pytest's `pytest.raises` to assert expected exceptions
- Test error conditions by providing invalid input or triggering error scenarios
- Validate proper error messages and exception types

Integration Testing:
- Test interactions between the bot and real Discord API endpoints
- Use a separate test environment or test bot for integration tests
- Mock external dependencies when necessary to isolate the tested functionality

Debugging and Troubleshooting:
- Use the `logging` module to add debug logs in the test framework
- Utilize pytest's verbose output (`-v` flag) for detailed test execution information
- Employ debugging tools like `pdb` or `pytest-pdb` for interactive debugging during test execution

This documentation provides an overview of the discord-test-framework module, including its installation, usage guide, testing best practices, and common test scenarios. By following the provided examples and guidelines, developers can effectively create and maintain comprehensive test suites for their Discord bots.
