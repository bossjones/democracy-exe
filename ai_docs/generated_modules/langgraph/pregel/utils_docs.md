# Module Documentation: Graph Processing Utilities

## Module Overview

This module provides utilities for handling version management and subgraph discovery in a graph-based processing system. It contains two main functions:

1. `get_new_channel_versions`: Compares version states and identifies new changes
2. `find_subgraph_pregel`: Traverses graph structures to locate Pregel subgraphs

### Key Dependencies
- langchain_core.runnables
- langgraph.checkpoint
- langgraph.pregel

## Installation and Setup

```bash
pip install langgraph langchain-core
```

## Usage Guide

### Version Management

The `get_new_channel_versions` function compares two version states to identify new changes:

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.base import ChannelVersions

# Example usage
previous = {"channel1": 1, "channel2": 2}
current = {"channel1": 2, "channel2": 2, "channel3": 1}

new_versions = get_new_channel_versions(previous, current)
# Returns: {"channel1": 2, "channel3": 1}
```

### Subgraph Discovery

The `find_subgraph_pregel` function traverses a graph structure to find Pregel subgraphs:

```python
from langgraph.pregel import Pregel
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableSequence

# Create a graph structure
graph = RunnableSequence([...])  # Your graph structure
subgraph = find_subgraph_pregel(graph)
```

## Testing Guide

### Test Suite

```python
# test_graph_utils.py
from __future__ import annotations

import pytest
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda, RunnableSequence
from langgraph.checkpoint.base import ChannelVersions
from langgraph.pregel import Pregel

from your_module import get_new_channel_versions, find_subgraph_pregel

class TestVersionManagement:
    @pytest.fixture
    def sample_versions(self) -> tuple[ChannelVersions, ChannelVersions]:
        """Provide sample version data for testing.

        Returns:
            tuple[ChannelVersions, ChannelVersions]: Previous and current versions
        """
        previous = {"channel1": 1, "channel2": 2}
        current = {"channel1": 2, "channel2": 2, "channel3": 1}
        return previous, current

    def test_new_channel_versions(self, sample_versions: tuple[ChannelVersions, ChannelVersions]) -> None:
        """Test identification of new channel versions.

        Args:

        """
        previous, current = sample_versions
        result = get_new_channel_versions(previous, current)

        assert "channel1" in result
        assert "channel3" in result
        assert "channel2" not in result
        assert result["channel1"] == 2
        assert result["channel3"] == 1

    def test_empty_previous_versions(self) -> None:
        """Test behavior with empty previous versions."""
        previous: ChannelVersions = {}
        current = {"channel1": 1, "channel2": 2}

        result = get_new_channel_versions(previous, current)

        assert result == current

class TestSubgraphDiscovery:
    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_pregel(self) -> Pregel:
        """Create a mock Pregel instance.

        Returns:
            Pregel: Mock Pregel instance
        """
        return Pregel(steps=[])  # Simplified mock

    def test_find_pregel_in_sequence(self, mock_pregel: Pregel) -> None:

        sequence = RunnableSequence([
            RunnableLambda(lambda x: x),
            mock_pregel
        ])

        result = find_subgraph_pregel(sequence)

        assert result == mock_pregel

    def test_no_pregel_found(self) -> None:
        """Test behavior when no Pregel subgraph exists."""
        sequence = RunnableSequence([
            RunnableLambda(lambda x: x),
            RunnableLambda(lambda x: x + 1)
        ])

        result = find_subgraph_pregel(sequence)

        assert result is None

    def test_disabled_checkpointing(self, mock_pregel: Pregel) -> None:
        """Test handling of disabled checkpointing.

        Args:
            mock_pregel: Mock Pregel instance
        """
        mock_pregel.checkpointer = False
        sequence = RunnableSequence([mock_pregel])

        result = find_subgraph_pregel(sequence)

        assert result is None
```

### Testing Best Practices

1. Version Management Testing:
   - Test with empty previous versions
   - Test with matching versions
   - Test with new channels
   - Test with updated versions
   - Test type handling

2. Subgraph Discovery Testing:
   - Test various graph structures
   - Test disabled checkpointing
   - Test nested structures
   - Test with different runnable types

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

```python
def test_version_type_consistency() -> None:
    """Test handling of inconsistent version types."""
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        get_new_channel_versions(
            {"channel1": "1"},  # type: ignore
            {"channel1": 1}
        )

def test_complex_nested_structure(mock_pregel: Pregel) -> None:
    """Test deeply nested graph structures."""
    nested = RunnableSequence([
        RunnableSequence([
            RunnableLambda(lambda x: x),
            mock_pregel
        ])
    ])

    result = find_subgraph_pregel(nested)
    assert result == mock_pregel
```

## Performance Considerations

- Version comparison is O(n) where n is the number of channels
- Subgraph discovery is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the graph
- Memory usage is proportional to the number of versions/nodes

## Debugging Tips

1. Enable logging for detailed traversal information:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

2. Use debugging breakpoints in complex graph structures:
```python
import pdb

def debug_graph_structure(graph: Runnable) -> None:
    pdb.set_trace()
    result = find_subgraph_pregel(graph)
```

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for understanding, using, and testing the module. The test examples cover the main functionality while following best practices for Python testing.
