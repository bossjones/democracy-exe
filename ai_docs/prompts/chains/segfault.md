You are acting as a Python Code Analysis Expert specializing in segmentation fault prevention and thread safety. Your task is to analyze code patterns and contribute to a growing knowledge base of segfault prevention strategies.

You have access to several key tools and frameworks:
1. segfault_fixer_cot_prompt.xml - Your methodology guide
2. segfault_fixer_expert.xml - The knowledge base you'll help build
3. The artifacts command system for knowledge persistence

Your primary focus is identifying, analyzing, and documenting effective patterns for preventing segmentation faults in Python code, with particular attention to:
- Thread safety mechanisms
- Memory management patterns
- Resource cleanup approaches
- Error handling systems
- Event loop protection

Please begin your analysis following the segfault_fixer_cot_prompt.xml framework. For each stage:
1. Think through your approach step-by-step
2. Document your reasoning clearly
3. Validate your findings thoroughly
4. Persist knowledge systematically

Start with Stage 0 (Initialization) of the framework. Before proceeding:
1. Review the current context
2. Document your understanding
3. Plan your approach
4. Establish success criteria

Place your thinking process in <thinking> tags, your analysis steps in <analysis> tags, and your findings in <findings> tags. Use the artifacts command to persist knowledge to segfault_fixer_expert.xml.

Let's begin with your initial context review and planning. What's your first step in analyzing the code base for segfault prevention patterns?

------

Let me explain how to structure the subsequent prompts in this analysis chain, building on our initial prompt while maintaining clarity and thorough documentation.

The key is to create a natural progression through our framework's stages while maintaining context and enabling deep analysis. Here's how we can structure the subsequent prompts:

After Initial Context (Stage 0) is complete, we'd use a prompt like this for Stage 1:

```plaintext
You've completed the initial context analysis for our segfault prevention patterns. Let's proceed with Stage 1 (Enhanced Code Analysis) of our framework.

Review your previous findings stored in segfault_fixer_expert.xml, then begin the pattern analysis phase. Remember to:
1. Think through each pattern's relevance
2. Consider implementation complexity
3. Document adaptation requirements
4. Validate your findings
5. Persist knowledge systematically

As you analyze, focus particularly on:
- Thread management patterns that could benefit democracy_exe
- Memory safety mechanisms that align with our needs
- Resource cleanup approaches that fit our context
- Exception handling patterns that enhance safety

Place your analysis process in <analysis> tags and document all significant patterns in segfault_fixer_expert.xml using the artifacts command.

What patterns do you identify in your initial analysis pass?
```

For Stage 2 (Pattern Synthesis), we'd build on the accumulated knowledge:

```plaintext
Now that we've identified key patterns, let's move to Stage 2 of our framework - Pattern Synthesis. Your previous analysis has given us a strong foundation of individual patterns. Now we need to understand how these patterns work together.

Review the patterns you've documented in segfault_fixer_expert.xml and consider:
1. How do these patterns interact?
2. Which combinations provide the most robust protection?
3. What implementation dependencies exist?
4. How can we optimize these patterns for democracy_exe?

Document your synthesis process in <synthesis> tags and update segfault_fixer_expert.xml with your findings about pattern relationships and integration strategies.

Begin by mapping the relationships between the patterns you've identified. What key pattern combinations emerge from your analysis?
```

For Stage 3 (Validation), we'd focus on verification:

```plaintext
You've synthesized our patterns and their relationships. Let's proceed with Stage 3 - Validation. Your task is to verify the effectiveness and practicality of our pattern implementations.

Review your previous work in segfault_fixer_expert.xml and:
1. Validate each pattern's effectiveness
2. Verify implementation feasibility
3. Test pattern combinations
4. Assess resource requirements
5. Identify potential risks

Document your validation process in <validation> tags and update segfault_fixer_expert.xml with validation results and any necessary adjustments to our patterns.

Begin with validating our core patterns. What validation criteria are most critical for our context?
```

For Stage 4 (Implementation Planning):

```plaintext
With our patterns validated, let's move to Stage 4 - Implementation Planning. Your task is to create a practical roadmap for implementing these patterns in democracy_exe.

Review the validated patterns in segfault_fixer_expert.xml and:
1. Create implementation sequences
2. Define resource requirements
3. Establish validation points
4. Plan for risk mitigation
5. Document success criteria

Record your implementation planning in <implementation> tags and update segfault_fixer_expert.xml with detailed implementation guides.

Start by outlining the critical path for implementation. What should be our first implementation priority?
```

Finally, for Stage 5 (Final Review):

```plaintext
We've reached our final stage - Comprehensive Review. Your task is to ensure our pattern catalog is complete, practical, and well-documented.

Review the entire knowledge base in segfault_fixer_expert.xml and:
1. Verify pattern completeness
2. Validate implementation guidance
3. Check documentation clarity
4. Assess future needs
5. Document open questions

Record your review findings in <review> tags and make final updates to segfault_fixer_expert.xml.

Begin with a high-level assessment of our pattern catalog. Have we achieved our core objectives for segfault prevention?
```

Key Principles for Chaining These Prompts:

1. Context Maintenance:
   - Each prompt references previous work
   - Clear connections between stages
   - Explicit knowledge base updates

2. Progressive Complexity:
   - Build on previous findings
   - Increase detail gradually
   - Maintain focus on key objectives

3. Knowledge Persistence:
   - Regular updates to expert system
   - Clear documentation requirements
   - Validation at each stage

4. Clear Deliverables:
   - Specific outputs required
   - Well-defined success criteria
   - Explicit validation requirements

5. Thinking Framework:
   - Encourages systematic analysis
   - Supports thorough documentation
   - Enables self-correction

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of these prompt chains or discuss specific strategies for handling the transitions between stages?

Human:

I notice there have been significant changes to segfault_fixer_expert.xml in your last update. Let's carefully evaluate these changes to ensure we're maintaining our valuable knowledge while allowing for necessary evolution of our understanding.

First, let's think critically about these changes:

1. Review your previous actions and document your thinking process about:
   - What specific changes were made?
   - Why were these changes considered necessary?
   - What valuable patterns might have been lost?
   - How do these changes affect our overall knowledge base?

2. Evaluate each major change against these criteria:
   - Does this change improve our understanding?
   - Does it remove valuable implementation details?
   - Does it break important pattern relationships?
   - Does it affect our validation framework?

3. For any potentially problematic changes:
   - What specific knowledge needs to be restored?
   - How can we integrate it with our current understanding?
   - What validation is needed?
   - How can we prevent similar issues?

Document your analysis in these structured tags:
<change_analysis>
   Document your review of the changes
</change_analysis>

<impact_assessment>
   Evaluate the impact on our knowledge base
</impact_assessment>

<recovery_plan>
   If needed, outline steps to restore valuable patterns
</recovery_plan>

<prevention_strategy>
   Suggest ways to prevent similar issues
</prevention_strategy>

After your analysis, if recovery is needed:
1. Clearly state what needs to be restored
2. Explain why it's valuable
3. Outline your restoration approach
4. Plan validation steps

Remember: Our goal is to maintain a robust, accurate knowledge base while allowing it to evolve appropriately. Think carefully about whether changes represent genuine improvements or accidental losses.

Begin by reviewing the recent changes and sharing your critical analysis. What specific modifications do you observe, and how should we proceed?

# Example response:

I recommend we proceed with the following immediate actions:
Restore Critical Patterns:
LangSmith client thread safety implementations
SSE stream handling patterns
Specific error handling cases
Domain-specific diagnostic points
Enhance Current Structure:
Add domain-specific sections to pattern_relationships
Create implementation-specific subsections
Cross-reference general and specific patterns
Add validation examples
Would you like me to proceed with restoring these critical patterns while maintaining the improved organizational structure?
```

How to follow up step-by-step:

```
I see you have a good overview of what needs to be restored. Let's break this down into careful, manageable steps to ensure we maintain quality and consistency. Let's start with just the first pattern category - LangSmith client thread safety implementations.

Please follow this process:

1. First, let's examine why this pattern category is critical:
   - Document your understanding of its importance
   - Explain how it relates to our segfault prevention goals
   - Identify key implementation scenarios
   - Note specific risks it addresses

Place your analysis in <pattern_importance> tags.

2. Then, for this specific pattern category:
   - Review what was previously documented
   - Identify any gaps or missing elements
   - Outline the core implementation details
   - Note critical validation requirements

Document these findings in <pattern_review> tags.

3. Finally, prepare the restoration by:
   - Formatting the pattern documentation
   - Structuring implementation guidelines
   - Creating validation criteria
   - Establishing cross-references

Present your restoration plan in <restoration_plan> tags.

Let's start with just this first pattern category. Please share your analysis of the LangSmith client thread safety implementations, and we'll validate each step before moving to implementation.

After we complete this first category successfully, we'll proceed with the same careful process for each subsequent pattern category.

What are your initial thoughts on the importance and critical elements of the LangSmith client thread safety patterns?
```

# when it's time to test
```
As a Python testing expert specializing in async safety and concurrency, let's systematically analyze and fix the test suite one test at a time. We'll follow a test-driven development approach with careful error analysis.

Starting with test_terminal_bot.py, let's:

1. First list all tests in the file using:
`uv run pytest --collect-only test_terminal_bot.py -v`

2. Then, for each test:
   a. Run it in isolation:
   `uv run pytest -s --verbose --showlocals --tb=short test_terminal_bot.py::test_name`

   b. If the test fails, provide your analysis in this format:

<error_analysis>
    <stack_trace>
        [Quote relevant parts of the stack trace]
    </stack_trace>

    <problematic_patterns>
        [Quote and explain specific code patterns causing issues]
    </problematic_patterns>

    <diagnostic_match>
        [Reference relevant diagnostic points from segfault_fixer_expert.xml]
    </diagnostic_match>
</error_analysis>

<fix_implementation>
    <current_code>
        [Show problematic test code]
    </current_code>

    <fixed_code>
        [Show fixed implementation with safety improvements]
    </fixed_code>

    <safety_improvements>
        [Explain specific safety enhancements]
    </safety_improvements>

    <validation_steps>
        [List steps to validate the fix]
    </validation_steps>
</fix_implementation>

3. After each fix:
   a. Run the test again to verify
   b. Check for any new issues
   c. Document the successful fix

Let's start with the first test in test_terminal_bot.py. Please:
1. Show me the list of tests
2. Run the first test in isolation
3. If it fails, provide your analysis and fix
4. If it passes, move to the next test

For each test, think carefully about:
- Async resource cleanup
- Event loop isolation
- Thread safety
- Error boundaries
- Resource lifecycle management

Let's begin with the first test. What tests are available in test_terminal_bot.py?
```
