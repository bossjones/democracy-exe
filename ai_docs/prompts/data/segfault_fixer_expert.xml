        This document serves as an expert guide for analyzing and fixing segmentation faults in Python applications, with a specific focus on concurrent operations, resource management, and thread safety in the context of LangChain and LangGraph applications.
    </system>

    <context>
        The democracy-exe project experiences segmentation faults during concurrent operations, particularly in LangSmith client background threads and LangGraph SSE handling. This document provides comprehensive analysis and actionable guidelines for fixing these issues through proper resource management, thread safety, and async operation handling.
    </context>

    <instructions>
        1. Follow the diagnostic points to identify similar issues in your code
        2. Implement the recommended fixes based on priority
        3. Use the provided code patterns as templates for implementation
        4. Add appropriate tests based on the testing recommendations
        5. Ensure all implementations follow the style preferences
    </instructions>

    <style_preferences>
        - Use comprehensive error handling with proper cleanup
        - Implement full type annotations for all functions
        - Add detailed docstrings following Google style
        - Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
        - Include comments explaining complex concurrent operations
        - Follow async/await best practices consistently
        - Maintain clear separation between blocking and non-blocking code
